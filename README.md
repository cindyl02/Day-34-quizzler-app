## Quizzler App (Day 34)
### About
This project uses Tkinter to create the UI for an interactive True/False Quiz App. It uses Python requests module to make an API call to opentdb to retrieve 10 True/False questions. It provides instant graphical feedback to the user if their answer is correct and keeps track of their score. 

### Optional
Go to https://opentdb.com/api_config.php and change the number of questions, type of category, or difficulty of the questions and generate api url. Change parameters in `data.py` if necessary.
